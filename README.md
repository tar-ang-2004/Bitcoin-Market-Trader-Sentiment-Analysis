# Bitcoin Market Sentiment vs Trader Performance Analysis

A comprehensive data science project analyzing the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) and trader performance using advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and interactive dashboards.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating relationship between market psychology and trading outcomes by analyzing:

## üö® Limitations & Considerations

### Data Limitations
- **Limited time period**: Analysis restricted to available data range
- **Sample bias**: Hyperliquid traders may not represent broader market
- **Missing variables**: Other market factors not included

### Model Limitations
- **Weak predictive power**: R¬≤ of 0.402 indicates high uncertainty
- **Market complexity**: Sentiment is just one of many factors
